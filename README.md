SLife AI in Telegram
======
ORGANISING ALL THE MESSAGES BY TAGS USING AI

## Introduction
This is my step-by-step guide on how I have integrated AI into my everyday life and sharing experiences from my life with my friends.

One of the most important things is that for AI to be as private as possible, which means that all the models will be downloaded and running locally 24/7 in my house on a server or a home PC. The only thing that will have connection to the Internet is Telegram API to pull the messages and push the edits.

If you read this, you probably already know something about Telegram Bot API and know how to use it. If you don’t, I suggest for you to check the Telegram API Manual online at https://core.telegram.org/

This entire experiment and all the programs will be built using Python. So make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed, and in case you don’t have it you can either go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ or alternatively use use Homebrew on macOS:
```bash
brew install python
```

You can check the Python version with this command:
